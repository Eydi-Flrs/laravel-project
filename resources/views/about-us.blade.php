We experienced having trouble looking for references that are much needed, especially when creating case studies, thesis papers, and even capstone projects. Especially since the pandemic occurred, it has been a struggle for us to rely on online academic resources and not even have a glimpse of what was the previous thesis projects to avoid the repetitive subjects and create much more reliable innovations for the future.</p>

Our main goal is to create an online platform wherein college students from our department could have an access to the previous research projects as well as the other academic resources that the college offers. It could be of great help since it can be saved and downloaded in just one click.</p>
